First, facilitator Steph Cruchon of Design Sprint Ltd gathered the agency’s combined experience of physical design sprints and looked for ways to make it efficient and enjoyable in a remote setting. At the same time, the creators of the methodology at Google, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, teamed up with Jackie Colburn to write an in-depth guide to run full five-day remote design sprints.

Together, they created this official template for remote sprints, invested personally in writing crystal clear instructions, and even added new exercises that don’t appear in the Sprint book but were part of their workshops.


 This template works hand in hand with the book and will help you run excellent 100% remote design sprints.
