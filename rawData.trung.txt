Mary often goes to school by bicycle.
I get up early every morning.
The sun rises in the East
The plane takes off at 3 p.m this afternoon

The children are playing football now.
Be quiet! The baby is sleeping in the next room.
Mary is going to a new school next term
Do you understand your lesson

Iâ€™ve played the guitar ever since I was a teenager
I have worked here since I left school
