Washington (CNN)When Chinese President Xi Jinping beamed into the White House on Monday evening for a virtual summit with President Joe Biden, the two men needed no introduction. "We've spent an awful lot of time talking to one another, and I hope we can have a candid conversation tonight as well," Biden said as the talks got underway, sitting at the head of the Roosevelt Room table as Xi's visage was broadcast on a pair of television screens. From his seat in a cavernous room inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi was just as friendly. "Although it's not as good as a face-to-face meeting," Xi said as the summit got underway, "I'm very happy to see my old friend." It was an auspicious start to some of the most critical talks of Biden's presidency, given the deteriorating ties between Washington and Beijing and the reality, acknowledged by administration officials, that managing the US relationship with China will amount to Biden's most critical international objective. The affable greetings eventually turned more serious as Biden raised concerns about human rights, Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and trade issues. Throughout, the leaders engaged in a "healthy debate," according to a senior administration official present for the discussions. Officials said the three-and-a-half hour summit, which stretched longer than planned, allowed the two men ample opportunity to diverge from their prepared talking points. The tone remained "respectful and straightforward," the officials said. But the highly anticipated summit yielded no major breakthroughs -- none were expected ahead of time -- and officials dismissed the notion the summit was intended to ease what has become an increasingly tense relationship. "I don't think the purpose was particularly to ease tensions, or that that was the result. We want to make sure the competition is responsibly managed, that we have ways to do that. The President's been quite clear he's going to engage in that stiff competition," the senior administration official said afterward. Biden is fond of citing the dozens of hours and thousands of miles he clocked with Xi when both were serving as their country's vice presidents. He's claimed to have spent more time with the Chinese president than any other world leader. But things have changed since Biden, as he likes to recall, was dining with Xi on the Tibetan Plateau and describing the United States in one word: "possibilities." Now, the world's two largest economies are engaged in fierce tensions on trade, military aggression and human rights. And Biden, who initiated Monday evening's virtual summit, finds himself in a high-wire act with China's most powerful leader in decades. During the summit, each man recounted stories from their time traveling with each other, sometimes quoting each other's words from that era, the senior administration official said. As the talks were getting underway, Biden said he was expecting to discuss a wide-ranging and substantive agenda. "As I've said before, it seems to me our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure the competition between our two countries does not veer into conflict, either intended or unintended. Just simply straightforward competition," he said, speaking to Xi through a translator. "It seems to me we have to establish some common sense guardrails, to be clear and honest where we disagree and work together where our interests intersect," Biden went on, asking to communicate "honestly and directly" over the range of topics up for discussion. "We never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking," he said. On Covid-19, Biden reaffirmed the importance of transparency in preventing future outbreaks of disease, a nod to China's unwillingness to allow an international investigation into the origins of the current pandemic. And he raised areas where the US and China can cooperate, including on climate change. The two countries recently surprised observers at the COP26 climate talks in Scotland with a joint pledge to cut emissions. After speculation Xi might use the meeting to invite Biden to the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, officials said the topic did not arise. White House officials had hoped a large South Lawn signing ceremony for a massive new public works package, which occurred a few hours before Biden's virtual summit, would help signal progress on the main underpinning of his foreign policy: proving democracies can deliver more effectively than autocracies like China. He planned to detail the new infrastructure package to Xi. The fact the bill was passed with help from some Republicans -- fulfilling Biden's promise to work across party lines -- helps sustain his pledge to prove democracies can work, according to the officials. Yet he still entered the talks at a politically weakened moment. His party fared poorly in off-year elections this month in Virginia, and polls continue to show his approval rating at some of the lowest levels of his presidency. That is in sharp contrast to Xi, whose consolidation of power in China was cemented last week when the Chinese Communist Party adopted a landmark resolution elevating him in stature to his two most powerful predecessors -- Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Officials said the upgrading of Xi's status only enhanced the imperative of a face-to-face with Biden. Nearly every issue Biden is focused on, domestically and internationally, has a nexus to China. Supply chain issues that are driving inflation at home can be traced in part to shortages in Chinese plants. Combatting climate change requires buy-in from Xi, who has shown some willingness to partner with Biden on the issue. Managing global trouble-spots like North Korea and Iran each involves coordination with Beijing. Biden is a fan of in-person meetings and complained early in his presidency that virtual summits -- where foreign leaders are patched in on video screens -- could not replicate the chemistry of sitting face-to-face. American officials say leader-to-leader meetings are even more important with Xi, whose inner circle has become smaller and smaller and who now wields a historic level of power. Over the summer, aides were hopeful of setting up a meeting between the two men on the sidelines of this year's Group of 20 summit in Rome. But Xi has not left China in nearly two years, partly over Covid-19 concerns. So Biden settled on a virtual summit instead as a way to advance his two previous phone conversations with Xi. "There is something different about actually seeing someone physically, about the depth of the conversation you can have, versus just on a regular phone line," the senior administration official said earlier, describing different ways of preparing for a video conference compared to just a phone conversation. The US strongly condemned a Russian anti-satellite test on Monday that forced crew members on the International Space Station to scramble into their spacecraft for safety, calling it "a reckless and dangerous act" and saying that it "won't tolerate" behavior that puts international interests at risk.  US Space Command said Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite, or DA-ASAT missile, striking a Russian satellite and creating a debris field in low-Earth orbit of more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris that is also likely to generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris. US officials emphasized the long-term dangers and potential global economic fallout from the Russian test, which has created hazards for satellites that provide people around the world with phone and broadband service, weather forecasting, GPS systems which underpin aspects of the financial system, including bank machines, as well in-flight entertainment and satellite radio and television. "Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations," said US Space Command commander Gen. James Dickinson. "The debris created by Russia's DA-ASAT will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers. Space activities underpin our way of life and this kind of behavior is simply irresponsible." NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement that he was "outraged by this irresponsible and destabilizing action. With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station." The crew on board the ISS had to quickly don their spacesuits and jump into their spacecrafts in case the station was hit by some passing debris, according to Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS. Two US officials told CNN the precautionary measures were a direct result of the debris cloud caused by the Russian test. There are currently seven astronauts on the space station, including NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov as well as the newly arrived Crew 3 mission team, NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. NASA said the "crew was awakened and directed to close the hatches to radial modules on the station," while hatches between the US and Russian segments remained open. "An additional precautionary measure of sheltering the crew was executed for two passes through or near the vicinity of the debris cloud," NASA's statement said. "The crew members made their way into their spacecraft shortly before 2 a.m. EST and remained there until about 4 a.m. The space station is passing through or near the cloud every 90 minutes, but the need to shelter for only the second and third passes of the event was based on a risk assessment made by the debris office and ballistics specialists at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston." On Monday morning, Shkaplerov tweeted, "Friends, everything is regular with us! We continue to work according to the program." Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the condemnations from Nelson and Dickinson in a statement Monday. "The long-lived debris created by this dangerous and irresponsible test will now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations' security, economic, and scientific interests for decades to come," Blinken said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test "will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities," adding that "Russia's claims of opposing the weapons and weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical." Only a handful of successful anti-satellite weapon tests have been carried out by the US, Russia, China and India. Price said the US would consult with allies and partners on a response. "I don't want to get to get ahead of specific measures that we may pursue, that our partners and allies may pursue, but we are going to continue to make very clear that we won't tolerate this kind of activity," Price said at Monday's State Department briefing, adding that the US wanted "to make very clear why this is so dangerous, why this is so, such irresponsible conduct on the part of a nation state." Price said the US had spoken to senior Russian officials several times to warn them about the danger of such a test but would not say whether there had been a formal diplomatic communication to Moscow. When asked about reports that the ISS crew had to seek shelter, Price referred reporters to Russia and stressed that both American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts were affected. The space station continues to be at risk of impact from objects too small to be tracked as it orbits 220 nautical miles above the Earth. These tiny objects could be pieces of rock, micrometeorites, dust particles or even flecks of paint that chip off of satellites. Space Command said it is examining the new wave of debris. "We are actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted," a Space Command spokesperson said. "We are also in the process of working with the interagency, including the State Department and NASA, concerning these reports and will provide an update in the near future." Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters at a Monday press briefing that the "most immediate concern is the debris itself, which is now floating out there, and could become a hazard, including to the International Space Station." Kirby said the Pentagon is watching "closely the kinds of capabilities that Russia seems to want to develop." "We watch closely the kinds of capabilities that Russia seems to want to develop which could pose a threat not just to our national security interest, but the security interests of other space-faring nations," Kirby said. "And again, we've been very clear, we would like to see norms for space, so that it can be used responsibly by all space-faring nations." The incident comes at a time of increased tensions between the US and Russia. US officials have publicly sounded the alarm about Russia's buildup of troops near its border with Ukraine and joined European nations in expressing concern about the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, which European officials have described as a man-made crisis that Belarus has created with Russian backing as an act of "hybrid war" against Europe. Northern Ireland is once again at the center of post-Brexit tensions between the United Kingdom and the European Union, after both sides fired up the rhetoric in recent days before promising to intensify talks.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Brexit minister, David Frost, argue that the Northern Ireland Protocol -- the part of the post-Brexit trade deal that keeps the UK's Northern Ireland in the EU single market, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state -- is not working as it stands. Speaking in Brussels just over a week ago, Frost suggested that if the EU does not give way to its demands, the UK could seek to trigger Article 16 of the Protocol -- a kind of emergency brake that allows either side unilaterally to implement measures, or "safeguards," if the Protocol leads to persistent "serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties" or to "diversion of trade." "Article 16 is very much on the table," he said, according to Reuters. "Time is running out." The UK demands include removing Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice, from any regulatory role in the Protocol and lessening checks and paperwork for goods moving between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. But the European Union remains adamant that the UK cannot seek to renegotiate the deal that was agreed by Johnson and Frost just 11 months ago to avert a potentially disastrous "no-deal" trade scenario -- and has indicated it's prepared to play hardball on the issue. Frost met again Friday with European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič -- their fourth such meeting in the past month. Their comments afterward suggested neither side wants to abandon talks and embark on a trade war just yet. Speaking at a news conference, Šefčovič welcomed what he called "the change in tone of discussion with David Frost," saying he hoped this would "lead to tangible results for the people in Northern Ireland," according to Reuters. Frost said "significant gaps" remained and that Brussels must address the "full range of issues" raised by the UK. But he agreed that intensified talks would take place in Brussels next week, according to a statement posted to Twitter. The back-and-forth has created fears of further Brexit-related turmoil, even as the UK's Conservative government grapples with ongoing supply chain issues exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, amid concern over how far each side is willing to go. "I think there's been essentially a scoping exercise going on -- or another way of putting it is a game of chicken -- and both sides are testing out the seriousness of the other," Catherine Barnard, professor of European and employment law at the University of Cambridge, told CNN. The latest tensions come on the heels of a nasty spat between the UK and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. "It may well be that the French were using the fishing dispute partly to get what they want on licenses, but also partly to show that the French are prepared to play dirty," Barnard said. "The EU has been briefing out all of the things that the EU would do if the UK triggers Article 16 unlawfully," Barnard explained. "Triggering Article 16 in and of itself is not an unlawful act. What is unlawful is using it to completely rewrite the Protocol." Despite the ongoing talks, Frost's remarks in Brussels have sparked wide speculation that the UK government may be preparing to trigger Article 16 imminently. Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major told the BBC last weekend that he suspected such a move could happen within days of the conclusion of the UK-hosted COP26 UN climate conference. This would be "colossally stupid," Major said, as he warned that suspending parts of the protocol would "add to destabilization in Northern Ireland" and erode UK relations with both Europe and Washington. The UK was negotiating over the protocol "with all the subtlety of a brick," he added. There are already signs of heightened tensions within Northern Ireland. Four men hijacked and set fire to a bus in a pro-British unionist community in a Belfast suburb last Sunday, Reuters reported, days after two masked men torched another bus in an attack local media suggested was tied to discontent over post-Brexit trade issues. The "safeguards" which could be implemented under Article 16 are not spelled out in the Protocol but could include steps such as either side imposing targeted tariffs, analysts say. There would also be an arbitration process. However, Johnson and Frost's dislike for the agreement they themselves signed last December has fueled fears the UK government could seek to use the Article 16 mechanism to achieve a wider aim of rewriting the deal. Johnson's government might seek to do this by suspending the provisions in the Protocol that keep Northern Ireland in the EU Customs Union and apply EU rules to goods, Barnard suggested, thereby undermining the entire Protocol. "If the UK were to do that, the EU has made it clear it would retaliate with force... in terms of a trade war," she said. There's even been some suggestion that the EU might suspend the main trade deal, or Trading Cooperation Agreement, with the UK, Emily Lydgate, deputy director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory and senior lecturer in law at the University of Sussex, told CNN. Frost appeared to soften his language somewhat in the UK House of Lords on Wednesday, saying he would not give up negotiating with the EU "unless and until it is abundantly clear that nothing more can be done. We are certainly not at that point yet." But he kept the emergency brake on the table, adding: "If, however, we do in due course reach that point, the Article 16 safeguards will be our only option." On the same day, Ireland's Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar warned that triggering Article 16 would not result in a better deal for the UK. "The message I'd send to Boris Johnson is that we have an agreement in relation to Northern Ireland, we have an agreement in relation to trade with the European Union -- don't jeopardize it," Varadkar said, according to the Irish Times. "You were part of negotiating it, you own it, it was hard won, it's a mistake to think that by escalating tensions or by trying to withdraw from any part of it, that you'll end up with a better deal: you won't." The Protocol was agreed between the UK and EU to reflect the special status of Northern Ireland: out of the EU, along with the rest of the UK, but sharing a soft land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. Under the Protocol, goods can flow freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic, avoiding the need for a hard border -- an essential measure in preventing a return to sectarian violence on the island. The UK agreed that it would in turn protect the EU's single market by enforcing checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the British mainland, effectively drawing a customs border down the Irish Sea. Full implementation of those checks has been delayed under repeatedly extended "grace periods." Nonetheless, there have been supply chain issues and unionists in Northern Ireland feel let down by the government in Whitehall. The UK government called in a paper published in July for a "significant change" to the Protocol and has since been effectively trying to renegotiate key elements, including the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the application of its rules. In October, the EU responded with an offer to streamline regulatory compliance checks within the framework of the deal. It was a "reasonably generous offer," said Barnard, but was contingent on the UK taking steps which have not yet been implemented. Carlo Petrucci, lecturer in EU law at the University of Essex, said the UK government's approach appeared to be motivated by domestic politics and that it was hard to tell how serious it was. Triggering Article 16, which could lead to retaliatory measures such as quotas or tariffs being imposed by the EU, would be a "dangerous game," he said. Such a move could also damage the UK's standing as it seeks to negotiate other trade deals. "Clearly the UK government is aware that there is a loss of international credibility at the moment that it wants to renege on the Protocol," Petrucci told CNN. Questioned in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Frost -- accused by opponents of "sabre-rattling" over the Protocol -- insisted that the UK government wanted to come to a negotiated agreement with the EU. That was, he said, "the best way forward for stability, sustainability and prosperity in Northern Ireland." Frost added: "I do not think that the threats that are swirling around of a reaction to Article 16 are in any way helpful, but obviously that is the business of the European Union." Emerging later Wednesday from talks with US President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen indicated that the United States was firmly in the EU corner on the issue. "President Biden and I, we share the assessment that it is important for peace and stability on the island of Ireland to keep the withdrawal agreement and to stick to the Protocol. This Protocol has managed to square the difficult circle that Brexit caused," she told reporters outside the White House. "We are willing as a European Union to show the utmost flexibility and we have shown utmost flexibility within the Protocol -- but it is important to stick to what we have agreed and signed together, to work with that." When plans for M+ were unveiled over a decade ago, many in China's art world breathed a sigh of relief. The Hong Kong museum could, they hoped, provide a safe space for the types of risqué, politically charged artworks that were impossible to show in the heavily censored galleries of Beijing and Shanghai. As it finally opens its doors to the public Friday, the multibillion-dollar institution finds itself in a far more complicated position. Since the introduction of last year's controversial National Security Law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, Hong Kong has undergone a marked cultural and political shift. Critics allege the wide-ranging legislation has been used to stifle dissent and clamp down on free expression, bringing the formerly freewheeling territory in line with other Chinese cities. But while the red lines denoting what is tolerated in mainland China are relatively well understood -- in the art world, at least -- in Hong Kong, they appear to be continually evolving as artists and galleries navigate the new law. Just last month, the University of Hong Kong ordered the removal of its famous "Pillar of Shame" sculpture, memorializing victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, from its campus after several members of the now-disbanded pro-democracy group that owned the work were arrested. In October, a new film censorship law was passed, while reports of galleries and institutions keeping sensitive artworks from display have become commonplace. As a government-backed institution housing a trove of over 1,500 Chinese contemporary artworks, including around two dozen by dissident artist Ai Weiwei, M+ is a high-profile test of the city's artistic and curatorial freedoms. The question for those visiting the museum this weekend may not only be what is on display, but what is not. While a political cloud hangs over the opening, excitement around M+ is tangible in the art world and beyond. Long touted as the region's equivalent to London's Tate Modern or New York's MoMA, it will showcase items from a vast 8,000-item collection of visual culture (encompassing art, design, architecture, photography and moving images) from the 20th and 21st centuries, with a heavy emphasis on telling stories about Asia, from Asia. "We are part of the first wave of international, transregional and even global institutions that are now arriving in Asia," said M+ deputy director, curatorial and chief curator Doryun Chong, pointing to the National Gallery of Singapore and the forthcoming Guggenheim Abu Dhabi as other museums offering historically neglected Asian-centric art narratives. When it comes to storytelling, M+'s young, diverse curatorial team -- and a wider staff made up of nearly 30 nationalities -- offers a certain edge, Chong said. "Building a museum of this scale, where nothing comparable exists -- and we're not just talking about Hong Kong, we're talking about greater China and maybe even the rest of Asia -- means that it's necessary to gather diverse work experiences and expertise to produce something that is best for us, that will set the standard of our region and perhaps for the rest of the world." This ambition is evident in the building itself, an elegant design by Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, in partnership with TFP Farrells and Arup. Its harbor-fronted facade interacts with the city's urban fabric via a massive LED screen that will display moving art instead of the commercial logos and advertisements peppering the rest of Hong Kong's iconic skyline. Other details, like the tower's terracotta cladding, a reference to traditional Chinese roof tiling; the wall-to-ceiling bamboo lining several gallery spaces; and a cavernous basement-level exhibition space that follows the contours of the active railway tunnel below it, help further root the design in its culture and locale. M+ has opened with six thematic shows across a sprawling 183,000 square feet of exhibition space. Of them, "M+ Sigg Collection: From Revolution to Globalisation" presents what is arguably the museum's pièce de résistance: The world's largest and most comprehensive collection of Chinese contemporary art from the 1970s to the 2000s. A landmark donation and part-sale of 1,500 items, by renowned collector and former ambassador to China Uli Sigg, put M+ on the map in 2012, catapulting it from museum-in-the-making to serious global arts player. But its contents have also raised difficult questions for curators and politicians alike. In particular, a 1997 photograph of Ai Weiwei raising a middle finger to Tiananmen Square was embroiled in controversy earlier this year, when the image was removed from the museum's website, where users can browse through items in its collections. (Other images from his "Study in Perspectives" series, showing him making the same gesture towards the "Mona Lisa" in the Louvre, the White House and the Federal Palace of Switzerland still appear on the site). The provocative photo contributed to a larger conversation about censorship fears, after a pro-Beijing lawmaker asked Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam whether M+ risked "inciting hatred" towards China. Lam responded by telling culture officials to be "extra cautious" that the museum does not cross an unspecified "red line," adding that while her government respected "freedom of artistic and cultural expression ... all Hong Kong compatriots are required to safeguard national security." Addressing reporters at a press preview on Thursday, chairman of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, stressed that the museum would "uphold and encourage the freedom of artistic expression and creativity" while ensuring "all exhibitions will comply with the laws ... including the National Security Law." Despite the political pressures, Sigg told CNN that M+ was still the best home for his collection, which he always believed should be displayed in China, if not the mainland. "I still think that's the way: The Chinese people can now or eventually can see their art, which they're not so familiar with yet," he said. "Maybe today we cannot show everything, but one day I am sure that whole collection can be shown. It's for the long haul, in my view." Sigg co-curated the opening selection, a list of artworks he said predates the National Security Law. "For me, it was an important test that the list would be respected, and these works would be shown," he said, adding that none of his original choices were removed. The show is expansive, over 200 items charting the emergence of contemporary art in China after the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976. Through movements like the avant-garde '85 new wave and Cynical Realism, which rose in tandem with crucial points in China's recent history, the works also reflect the country's economic rise and breakneck urban development. Wang Xingwei's "New Beijing," feels especially confrontational in the current climate -- a satirical oil painting showing bloodied emperor penguins lying on a bicycle cart, a thinly veiled allusion to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and the deaths of pro-democracy protesters. Subversive portraits of former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong also appear throughout, as do videos of closed-door art performances and underground exhibitions tackling taboo subjects such as nudity and free speech. Ai's middle finger is nowhere to be seen, but two of his works do appear: an installation of his earthenware jars and a 2004 video capturing Beijing's Chang'an Boulevard, the street running from east to west via rural villages, the capital's business district and right through the heart of government power. Sigg recalled taking a group of art collectors around the museum ahead of the opening, saying that "some of the patrons were crying, they were so moved by what they saw." "It was unexpected to see Chinese contemporary art, at this depth and in this width, even when I'm talking about art collectors," he added. "They made so many new discoveries, they were simply impressed by their own artists. That is what I hope to see again and again. That would be my biggest pleasure." Beyond the hotly-debated Sigg Collection, large-scale acquisitions offer intrigue outside the political. With its sheer enormity, British sculptor Antony Gormley's 2003 work "Asian Field" commands its own exhibition: Tens of thousands of clay figurines stare back at the viewer, a mesmerizing display of hand-sized pieces produced by 300 villagers in southern China. The show "Things, Spaces, Interactions," offers visitors an entire sushi bar to explore. Dismantled in Tokyo and reinstalled inside the museum, "Kiyotomo" is one of the few remaining examples of interior design by the celebrated Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. It is one of several displays demonstrating the museum's ambitious efforts to preserve and document design and architecture -- not only in greater China, but Asia as a whole.
