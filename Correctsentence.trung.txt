While fatigue , drowsiness or boredom easily bring on yawn , scientist be discover there be more to yawn than most people think Not much be know about why we yawn or if it serf any useful function People have already learn that yawn can be infectious “ Contagious yawn ” be the increase in likelihood that you will yawn after watch or hearing someone else yawn , but not much be know about the under-lying cause , and very little research have be do on the subject However , scientist at the University of Albany , a well a the University of Leeds and the University of London have do some exploration It be commonly believe that people yawn a a result of be sleepy or tire because they need oxygen However , the late research show that a yawn can help cool the brain and help it work more effectively , which be quite different from the popular belief that yawn promotes sleep and be a sign of tiredness Dr.Andrew Gallup and his colleague at the University of Albany in New York State say their experiment on 44 student show that raise or lower oxygen and carbon dioxide level in the blood do not produce that reaction In the study participant be show video of people laugh and yawn , and researcher count how many time the volunteer respond to the “ contagious yawn ” The researcher found that those who breathe through the nose rather than the mouth be le likely to yawn when watch a video of other people yawn The same effect be found among those who held a cool pack to their forehead , whereas those who held a warm pack yawn while watch the video Since yawn occurs when brain temperature rise , send cool blood to the brain serf to maintain the best level of mental efficiency Yawning be universal to human and many animal Cats , dog and fish yawn just like human do , but they yawn spontaneously Only human and chimpanzee , our closest relative in the animal kingdom , have show definite contagious yawn Though much of yawn be due to suggestibility , sometimes people do not need to actually see a person yawn to involuntarily yawn themselves : hearing someone yawn or even reading about yawn can cause the same reaction However , contagious yawn go beyond mere suggestibility Recent study show that contagious yawn be also related to our predisposition toward empathy— the ability to understand and connect with others ’ emotional state So empathy be important , sure , but how could it possibly be related to contagious yawn ?
Leave it up to psychologist at Leeds University in England to answer that In their study , researcher select 40 psychology student and 40 engineering student Generally , psychology student be more likely to feel empathy for others , while engineering student be thought to be concerned with object and science Each student be make to wait individually in a wait room , along with an undercover assistant who yawn 10 time in a many minute The student be then administer an emotional quotient test : student be show 40 image of eye and ask what emotion each one displayed The result of the test support the idea that contagious yawn be link to empathy The psychology students—whose future profession require them to focus on others—yawned contagiously an average of 5 5 time in the wait room and score 28 out of 40 on the emotional test The engineering students—who tend to focus on thing like number and systems—yawned an average of 1 5 time and score 25 5 out of 40 on the subsequent test The difference doesn ’ t sound like much , but researcher consider it significant Strangely enough , woman , who be generally consider more emotionally attune , didn ’ t score any high than men Another study , lead by Atsushi Senju , a cognitive researcher at the University of London , also sought to answer that question People with autism disorder be consider to be developmentally impaired emotionally Autistics have trouble connect with others and find it difficult to feel empathy Since autistics have difficulty feel empathy , then they shouldn ’ t be susceptible to contagious yawn To find out , Senju and his colleague place 49 kid age 7 to 15 in a room with a television 24 of the test subject have be diagnose with autism spectrum disorder , the other 25 be non-autistic kid The test subject be show short clip of people yawn a well a clip of people opening their mouth but not yawn While the kid with autism have the same lack of reaction to both kind of clip , the non-autistic kid yawn more after the clip of people yawn There also have be study that suggest yawn , especially psychological “ contagious ” yawn , may have developed a a way of keep a group of animal alert and bonding member of a group into a more unit one If an animal be drowsy or bore , it may not be a alert a it should to be prepared to spring into action and it yawn be practically say , “ Hey , I need some rest , you stay awake ” Therefore , a contagious yawn could be an instinctual reaction to a signal from one member of the herd remind the others to stay alert when danger come So the theory suggests evidence that yawn come from the evolution of early human to be ready to physically exert themselves at any give moment Bondi Beach be one of Australia 's most well-known beach and among the world 's most famous Bondi Beach be locate in a suburb of Sydney , 7 kilometre east of the Sydney central business district Bondi be say to be a corruption of an Aboriginal word boondi meaning water break over rock It have be spelt a number of different way over time , e g Boondi , Bundi , Elundye The Australian Museum record that Bondi mean a place where a flight of nullas take place The current spell be accepted in 1827 Aboriginal people occupy many site in the area now know a Waverley in the period before European settlement There v/ere numerous record sighting during the early colonial period and there be significant aboriginal rock carving , include rough carving of fish or fish on the cliff The indigenous people of the area , at the time of European settlement , have generally be refer to a the Sydney people or the Eora , which mean `` the people '' There be no clear evidence for the name or name of the particular band or band of the Eora that roam what be now the Waverley area A number of place name within Waverley , most famously Bondi , have be base on word derive from Aboriginal language of the Sydney region Formal European settlement go back to 1809 , when the early road builder , William Roberts receive a grant of 81 hectare from Governor Bligh , of what be now most of the business and residential area of Bondi Beach In 1851 , Edward Smith Hall and Francis O ’ Brien purchase 200 acre of the Bondi area that embrace almost the whole frontage of Bondi Beach Between 1855 and 1877 O'Brien purchase Hall 's share of the land , rename the land the `` O'Brien Estate '' , and make the beach and the surround land available to the public a a picnic ground and amusement resort As the beach become increasingly popular , O'Brien threaten to stop public beach access However , the Municipal Council believe that the Government need to intervene to make the beach a public reserve However it be not until June 9 , 1882 , that the NSW Government act and Bondi Beach become a public beach In the early 1800s swim at Sydney 's beach be a controversial pastime In 1803 , Governor Philip King forbade convict from bathing in Sydney Harbour because of `` the danger of shark and stingray , and for reason of decorum '' But by the 1830s sea bathing be become a popular activity , despite be officially ban between 9:00 be and 8:00 pm During the 1900s these restrictive attitude begin to relax and the beach become associate with health , leisure and democracy Bondi Beach be a work class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century with migrant people comprise the majority of the local population The first tramway reach the beach in 1884 and the tram become the first public transportation in Bondi As an alternative , this action change the rule that only wealthy people cou\d enjoy the beach By the 1930s Bondi be draw not only local visitor but also people from elsewhere in Australia and overseas The increase popularity of sea bathing during the late 1800s and early 1900s raise concern about public safety In response , the world 's first formally document surf lifesaving club , the Bondi Surf Bathers ' Life Saving Club be form in February 1906 , the first club house be a simple tent in the dune This be powerfully reinforce by the dramatic event of `` Black Sunday '' at Bondi in 1938 Some 35,000 people be on the beach and a large group of lifesaver be about to start a surf race when three freak wave hit the beach , sweep hundred of people out to sea Lifesavers rescue 300 people , the large mass rescue in the history of surf bathing Bondi Beach be the end point of the City to Surf Fun Run , the large run event in the world , which be held each year in August Australian surf carnival far instill this image Particularly popular during the inter-War year and immediately after World War ll , these display of pageantry , discipline , strength and skill drew large crowd and even royal attention A Royal Surf Carnival be held at Bondi Beach for Queen Elizabeth 11 during her first tour to Australia in 1954 In addition to many activity , Bondi Beach Market be open every Sunday Many wealthy people spend Christmas Day at the beach However , a shortage of house occurs when lot of people rush to the seaside Manly be the seashore town which solve this problem However , people still choose Bondi a their destination rather than Manly A commercial retail centre be separate from Bondi Beach by Campbell Parade , and Bondi Park , feature many popular cafe , restaurant , and hotel , with view of the beach The valley run down to the beach be famous over the world for it view of distinctive red tile roof These architectural style be deeply influence by the coastal town in England In the last decade , Bondi Beaches ' unique position have see a dramatic rise in svelte contemporary house and apartment to take advantage of the view and scent of the sea Bondi Beach host the beach volleyball competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics A temporary 10,000-seat stadium , a much small stadium , 2 warm-up court , and 3 training court be set up to host the tournament and only stood for six week The stadium have uncovered seat around three side , and a partly cover stand on one side Campaigners oppose both the social and environmental consequence of the development `` They 're prepared to risk life and risk the Bondi beach environment for the sake of eight day of volleyball '' , say Stephen Uniacke , a construction lawyer involve in the campaign Other environmental concern include the possibility that soil dredge up from below the sand will acidify when brought to the surface The story of tea begin in China According to legend , in 2737 BC , the Chinese emperor Shen Nung be sit beneath a tree while his servant boil drinking water , when some leaf from the tree blew into the water Shen Nung , a renowned herbalist , decide to try the infusion that his servant have accidentally create The tree be a Camellia sinensis , and the result drink be what we now call tea It be impossible to know whether there be any truth in this story But tea drinking certainly become establish in China many century before it have even be heard of in the West Containers for tea have be found in tomb date from the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC— 220 AD ) but it be under the Tang Dynasty ( 618—906 AD ) , that tea become firmly establish a the national drink of China It become such a favourite that during the late eighth century a writer call Lu Yu write the first book entirely about tea , the Ch ’ a Ching , or Tea Classic It be shordy after this that tea be first introduce to Japan , by Japanese Buddhist monk who have travel to China to study Tea receive almost instant imperial sponsorship and spread rapidly from the royal court and monastery to the other section of Japanese society So at this stage in the history of tea , Europe be rather lag behind In the latter half of the sixteenth century there be the first brief mention of tea a a drink among Europeans These be mosdy from Portuguese who be living in the East a trader and missionary But although some of these individual may have brought back sample of tea to their native country , it be not the Portuguese who be the first to ship back tea a a commercial import This be do by the Dutch , who in the last year of the sixteenth century begin to encroach on Portuguese trading route in the East By the turn of the century they have establish a trading post on the island of Java , and it be via Java that in 1606 the first consignment of tea be ship from China to Holland Tea soon become a fashionable drink among the Dutch , and from there spread to other country in continental western Europe , but because of it high price it remain a drink for the wealthy Britain , always a little suspicious of continental trend , have yet to become the nation of tea drinker that it be today Starting in 1600 , the British East India Company have a monopoly on import good from outside Europe , and it be likely that sailor on these ship brought tea home a gift The first coffee house have be establish in London in 1652 , and tea be still somewhat unfamiliar to most reader , so it be fair to assume that the drink be still something of a curiosity Gradually , it become a popular drink in coffee house , which be a much location for the transaction of business a they be for relaxation or pleasure They be though the preserve of middle- and upper- class men ; woman drank tea in their own home , and a yet tea be still too expensive to be widespread among the work class In part , it high price be due to a punitive system of taxation One unforeseen consequence of the taxation of tea be the growth of method to avoid taxation—smuggling and adulteration By the eighteenth century many Britons want to drink tea but could not afford the high price , and their enthusiasm for the drink be match by the enthusiasm of criminal gang to smuggle it in What begin a a small time illegal trade , sell a few pound of tea to personal contact , developed by die late eighteenth century into an astonish organise crime network , perhaps import a much a 7 million lb annually , compare to a legal import of 5 million lb !
Worse for die drinker be that taxation also encourage the adulteration of tea , particularly of smuggle tea which be not quality control through custom and excise Leaves from other plant , or leaf which have already be brew and then dry , be add to tea leaf By 1784 , the government realise that enough be enough , and that heavy taxation be create more problem than it be wordi The new Prime Minister , William Pitt the Younger , slash the tax from 119 per cent to 12 5 per cent Suddenly legal tea be affordable , and smuggle stop virtually overnight Another great impetus to tea drinking result from the end of the East India Company ’ s monopoly on trade with China , in 1834 Before that date , China be the country of origin of the vast majority of the tea import to Britain , but the end of it monopoly stimulate the East India Company to consider grow tea outside China India have always be the centre of the Company ’ s operation , which lead to the increase cultivation of tea in India , begin in Assam There be a few false start , include the destruction by cattle of one of the early tea nursery , but by 1888 British tea import from India be for the first time great than those from China The end of the East India Company ’ s monopoly on trade with China also have another result , which be more dramatic though le important in the long term : it ushered in the era of the tea clipper While the Company have have the monopoly on trade , there be no rush to bring the tea from China to Britain , but after 1834 the tea trade become a virtual free for all Individual merchant and sea captain with their own ship race to bring home the tea and make the most money , use fast new clipper which have sleek line , tall mast and huge sail In particular there be competition between British and American merchant , lead to the famous clipper race of the 1860s But these race soon come to an end with the opening of the Suez canal , which make the trade route to China viable for steamship for the first time
